## Name
Replicating Unifying Electronic Health Record Systems via Text Embedding


## Description

This repo attempts to replicate the paper `Unifying Heterogeneous Electronic Health Records Systems via Text-Based Code Embedding`. It processes the eICU and MIMIC-III databases into an embedding using either a Text Encoder model or a RNN trained on sequences of medical events. The Text Encoder model is swappable, in practice we use BERT and BERT-Tiny. A Bidirectional-RNN using GRUs is then trained to make medical outcome predictions (e.g. Mortality) using the Medical Code or Medical Text embeddings from the Encoder layer as input. The .ipynb contains code to train, evaluate and plot performance of both models.

## Installation
Spin up a Conda environment and make sure to install the packages listed in `install.sh`. The major dependencies are PyTorch, PyHealth, BERT, Transformers and the standard Numpy/ScikitLearn/Pandas stack.

This project also requires the MIMIC-III and eICU datasets. Place these in a `home` directory relative path e.g. `~/ehr_data/*` and provide the path to the `.ipynb` in global vars `MIMIC_DATA_DIR_` and `EICU_DATA_DIR_`. If you have a GPU with > 4GB RAM you can enable/disable GPU eval and training via `BERT_USE_GPU_` and `USE_GPU_`. Dev mode can be enabled using the `DEV_` env variable, this loads a small subset of either dataset to test new code.

&nbsp;

## Layout 

### Trainlib

`trainer.py`

Contains Trainer class that accepts a dict of args controlling Model training parameters. E.g. `args.embed_model_type` and `args.predict_model_type` control the type of embedding and prediction model instantiated. Can be `desc_emb_ft`, `desc_emb`, or `code_emb`.  `args.task` and `args.db_name` control the prediction task requested e.g Mortality, LOS, or Readmission. The DB name controls which EHR datset is used for train or eval. `args.eval_only` controls wether training or eval is requested. Set to False to train + eval model. Set to true to evaluate model on test dataset. `args.collate_fn` and `args.no_use_cached_dataset` allow you to pass a Torch.Dataset and a torch `collate_fn` to the Trainer in place of loading a preprocessed dataset already saved on disk. The latter is much faster but less flexible. Common training hyperparameters can be set via `args.n_epochs`, `args.learning_rate`. `args.is_dev` can be used to load different cached dataset files from disk for dev mode and full mode, i.e. a different pathname is used to load data.

&nbsp;

### Tasks

`code_emb_funcs.py`, `desc_emb_funcs.py`, `eicu_funcs.py`

The above  three files contain [pyHealth Task functions](https://pyhealth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/tasks.html) that process the relevant dataset (eICU, MIMIC-III) into a sequence of [PyHealth Visits](https://pyhealth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/data/pyhealth.data.Visit.html).

In the case of CodeEmb Visits are sequences of ICD9/ICD10 codes that are transformed into a Tensor representing a sequence of multi-hot vectors, 1 per visit, per patient `(Batch, #Visits, #Events, MultiHotEmbDim)`. The CodeEmb collate function sums the multi-hot vectors along the #Events dimension resulting in a Tensor with dim `(Batch, #Visits, MultiHotEmbDim)`.

In the case of DescEmb Visits are sequences of natural language event descriptions (e.g. 'Aspirin 81mg Tab' or 'Colonoscopy', or 'Calculated Total CO2'). The sequences are embedded using the Text Encoder (BERT, RNN, BERT-Tiny) to a vector of length `embedding_dim` creating a Tensor with dimensions `(Batch, #MedicalEvents/Patient, EmbeddingDim)`.  Embedding dime is 768 for BERT and 128 for BERT-Tiny.

The embeddings generated by CodeEmb or DescEmb are then fed to a Bi-directional RNN prediction layer. This is the `predict_model_type`. The iput is shape `(Batch, #MedicalEvents/Patient, EmbeddingDim)` for DescEmb. The input is shape `(Batch, #Visits, MultiHotEmbDim)` for CodeEmb.


`collate_funcs.py`

Contains the different collate functions for each of the 3 embedding model types \[`code_emb`, `desc_emb_ft`, `desc_emb`\].


`dataset_transforms.py`

Contains `class TextEmbedDataset` which extends [PyHealth's SampleDataset](https://pyhealth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/datasets.html) with a caching & transform function. The transform can be used to apply the `BertTextEmbedTransform` or `BertFineTuneTransform` which computes text embeddings for each sample. This can be used to preprocess the samples in your dataset and cache them to disk to avoid doing it during each training epoch.

&nbsp;

### Models

`ehr_model.py`

Extends `nn.Module` and accepts the top level `Trainer` args struct. Uses the 2 parameters \[`args.embed_model_type`, `args.predict_model_type`\] to load the models needed for CodeEmb, DescEmb or DescEmbFineTune prediction. This class contains no nn layers, just 2 models. The forwards pass invokes the embedding model, then passes the embedding model output to the prediction model.

```
def forward(self, **kwargs):
    x, rev_x = self.embed_model(**kwargs)  # (B, S, E)
    kwargs['x'] = x
    kwargs['rev_x'] = rev_x
    net_output = self.pred_model(**kwargs)
```

`code_emb.py` 

Implements the CodeEmb models: `class CembEmbed` and `class CembRNN`.

`desc_emb.py` 

Implements the DescEmb models: `class DembEmbed` and `class DembRNN`. Note: DembEmbed is a passthrough (Identity) layer because when BERT is not updated the BERT embeddings can be computed once during preprocessing in `TextEmbedDataset + BertTextEmbedTransform`.

`desc_emb_fine_tune.py` 

Implements the DescEmb models: `class DembFtEmbed` and `class DembFtRNN`. Note: DembFtEmbed invokes BERT to compute text embeddings, and BERT weights are updated during training. This is __slow__ and GPU is __required__ to train this model in a reasonable amount of time.


&nbsp;

### Datsets

`dataset.py`

Implements `class DatasetCacher` which accepts a `torch.Dataset`, a batch size, and a dataset length and writes the dataset to file using `pickle`. The filenames are hashes derived from the input arguments preventing collisions. This is used to store preprocessed `torch.Datasets` to disk.

Implements `class StructuredDataset`, a wrapper around `torch.Dataset` which uses a `metadata` dictionary to combine keywords and a sample tuple `zip(['x', 'rev_x', 'label'], samples_tuple)` into a dictionary. This dictionary is passed to `class EHRModel.forward(**kwargs)` as the kwargs argument during training/eval. The metadata dictionary is part of the preprocessed dataset stored on-disk in `pickle` format. This saves compute when loading samples each epoch.

&nbsp;

## Usage

Open the `.ipynb` file. Run the cells under the `Preprocessing` header to load, process, and save a dataset to disk before traning. Load one of the datasets using `Load MIMIC III Data` or `Load eICU Data` cells. Next run the `Dataloaders and Collate` cell corresponding to one of the three tasks you wish to perform ( `desc_emb_ft`, `desc_emb`, or `code_emb`) on the loaded dataset. Then cache the preprocessed dataset to disk using `Dataset Caching` cells.

To train a model on the cached dataset use one of the `Condensed Traning using Trainer` cells corresponding to the EHR prediction task you are interested in (e.g. Morality, Readimission, Length-of-Stay). This will load the cached data, create a `Trainer` object containing a `class EHRModel`, and invoke its `train()` function on the model. Eval on the test set is performed by `Trainer` and results are returned and plotted. If __NOT__ interested in training, a pretrained model can be evaluated by setting `args.eval_only = True`. Note: you have to train at least once in order to load a pre-trained model, they are not included in the repo.

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
